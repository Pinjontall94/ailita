This repo contains the code for my neural network implementation from first 
principles. Note that this code is not based on any existing NNFS project,
as I'm basing this entirely on principles outlined in 
[this 3b1b series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi),
as well as this online 
[book by Michael Nielsen](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/).
